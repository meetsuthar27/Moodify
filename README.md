#  Moodify - A Mood-Based Chrome Filter Extension

Moodify is a simple yet fun Chrome extension that lets users apply visual filters to websites based on their mood. Whether you're feeling dreamy, vintage, or need a dimmed vibe for late-night browsing, Moodify has a style for you.

This project was built as a way to explore Chrome Extension development using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It uses the Chrome Storage API to remember your filter preferences and reapply them whenever you revisit the browser.

##  Features

-  **Mood-based filters** (5 basic filters in the compact view)
-  **Expanded filter list** (16 unique filters in expanded popup)
-  **Custom filter settings** (adjust brightness, hue, saturation, contrast)
-  **Data persistence** using Chrome's `storage.sync` API
-  **Manifest V3** based Chrome extension
-  Lightweight frontend with no external frameworks

```

### 2. Open Chrome and navigate to:
```chrome://extensions/```

### 3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right corner)

### 4. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the project folder

That‚Äôs it! üéâ You‚Äôll now see the Moodify extension in your Chrome toolbar.

Click the icon to choose a filter and watch your browsing experience transform based on your mood.

##  How It Works

- Each filter corresponds to a **CSS class** applied to the current page.
- The user's filter preference is stored using Chrome's `storage.sync` so it persists across sessions.
- On page load, a **content script** checks for saved filters and reapplies them automatically.
- The **"Custom"** option allows manual adjustment of visual properties like:
  - Brightness
  - Hue rotation
  - Saturation
  - Contrast

##  Future Improvements

-  Publish to Chrome Web Store  
-  Add mood-based automation using time of day  
-  More animated or interactive filters  
-  Option to exclude specific websites
